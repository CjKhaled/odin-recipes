    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>Evaporated milk</li>
        <li>Half and half</li>
        <li>Cake mix</li>
        <li>Almond milk</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and half and half in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. This is a sauce, not a syrup, so consistency will be on the thinner side.</li>
        <li>Add cake mix, almond milk, eggs, and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil to a large bowl, and beat vigorously by hand for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat, and lightly coat with remaining vegetable oil. Add 1/4 cup of the batter for each pancake. Cook until edges begin to puff up, small bubbles appear, pop, and leave small holes, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Serve pancakes warm with a drizzle of the tres leches sauce, a dollop of whipped cream, and sprinkle of cinnamon.</li>
    </ol>
